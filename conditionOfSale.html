You are responsible for ensuring that any wording you provide for personalizing products is correct.</p>
                        <p>In addition, orders for personalized products cannot be cancelled and such products that have been personalized in any way or otherwise made to your bespoke specifications cannot be returned to us for exchange or refund (except where defective), and are considered final upon receipt of a written Acknowledgement of Order, as described in these Conditions of Sale.

                        <p>For orders placed through the Client Relations Center or the Remote Boutique, the Maison associate will assist you in placing your order and will verbally ask you to confirm the details of your order.</p>
                        <p>For orders placed through the Platforms, desired products should be placed in the shopping bag (subject to availability and quantity limits) and you should proceed to “checkout” when ready to purchase. During the checkout process, you should review your shopping bag to confirm all details prior to completing your purchase.  Except for personalized products (as further detailed above), product is not guaranteed as available for purchase until the order is placed and you receive a written Confirmation of Order & Shipment.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to refuse, cancel and terminate orders at any time on reasonable grounds. For example, we may refuse, terminate or cancel your order if there is an ongoing dispute concerning payment of a prior order or if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in (i) fraudulent activities; (ii) the import of product activities which we have not intended; or (iii) have otherwise violated these Conditions of Sale.</p>

                        <p>All prices shown or quoted by the applicable Sales Channels are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated and exclude sales tax, shipping costs and other taxes unless otherwise stated. Sales, use or other taxes will vary based on the location to which products are being delivered. You should check updated prices and currency carefully.</p>
                        <p>Shipping and handling costs, if any, are described in the Shipping Policy below or by the applicable Sales Channels. Shipping and handling costs will only be added to the product price after you have chosen your delivery options, and will be summarised before you are asked to confirm and place your order.</p>
                        <p>We take reasonable care that the prices of products and delivery costs are correct when the relevant information is communicated to you via the Sales Channels. However, it is possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the products offered or shipping and handling costs may be incorrectly priced and/or applicable laws have changed that may impact taxes associated with your order. If any of the products or any delivery costs are incorrectly priced and/or a different tax applies, we will contact you as soon as possible to reconfirm the order and new amounts. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you have provided during the order process, we will cancel the order and notify you in writing. If we mistakenly accept and process your order where a pricing or delivery cost error occurs, we may cancel the order and refund you any sums you have paid.</p>

                        <p>We accept the payment methods identified in the order process via the Sales Channels. When ordering, you will need to provide your payment details through the appropriate Sales Channels. Depending on the means of payment, we may require additional information, including specific forms of identification.  All payment card holders are subject to validation check and authorization by the card issuer. If your payment card issuer refuses to authorize payment to us, you will need to contact your card issuer directly to solve this problem.</p>
                        <p>Other payment methods may also be subject to validation checks and authorization by the payment system providers. You expressly authorize us to perform security checks, where we deem necessary, to transmit or to obtain information (including any updated information) about you to or from third parties, including but not limited to your payment card details, to authenticate your identity, validate your payment card, obtain an initial payment card authorization, and authorize individual purchase transactions.</p>
                        <p>Depending on your payment method, type, and nature of your purchase, your account may be immediately debited during the checkout process or a hold may be placed on your account for a period of time or until the product is shipped.  Please contact the Sales Channels or your payment card provider for more details. </p>
                        <p>Where we offer a financing option and you choose to use it to pay for your order, the payment and finance option will be subject to both these Conditions of Sale and the applicable terms and conditions of our finance provider, who is disclosed before or during the checkout process.  You will have the opportunity to acknowledge and agree to the finance provider’s terms and conditions before confirming the finance option as your method of payment.  Note that any selected product(s) and/or service(s) will be held for a limited period of time to permit you to complete the financing process and will be released if you fail to complete the purchase within the time limits. </p>
                        <p>Where we offer you the ability to prepay for your products, either in full or as a partial prepayment, the prepayment will be taken immediately following the placement of your order and subject to the specific requirements communicated by the applicable Sales Channels during the prepayment process. Prepayments (in whole or in part) are non-refundable; however, prepayments shall not impact your legal rights under these Conditions of Sale. </p>
                        <p>When using the Sales Channels, we only accept bank wire transfer for orders placed by telephone through the Client Relations Center, and such orders are subject to an order approval process. We do not charge a fee for bank wire transfers; however, some financial institutions may charge a fee for using a bank wire transfer. Your order will not be processed until the payment has been received and confirmed by us, and will be cancelled if the wire transfer payment is not credited into our bank account within seven (7) days after the order is placed.</p>
                        <p>Maison is prohibited under U.S. law from making sales of its goods to individuals or companies designated on the Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) List, or to country destinations sanctioned by the U.S.  Any such transactions will be declined.</p>

Please make sure that you save this order reference number for any future enquiries regarding your order. Except for personalized products as outlined above, this Acknowledgement of Order is not an acceptance of your order.

                        <p><b>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return Process</b></p>
                        <p>In accordance with these Conditions of Sale, products that have been purchased through the Sales Channels may be returned to any IWC Schaffhausen retail boutique.  Products purchased through the Platforms or Client Relations Center may also be returned to our Maison e-boutique distribution center at the address of our Returns Department. Products that have not been purchased through the Sales Channels may NOT be returned to our e-boutique distribution center. For example, if you purchase a product at a retail boutique, you should return it at a IWC Schaffhausen boutique.</p>
                        <p>To return an eligible product to our e-boutique distribution center, please contact our Client Relations Center to start your return.  You must keep a proof of return shipment, and we accept no liability in the event that such proof cannot be produced. Only merchandise received by our Maison e-boutique distribution center will be eligible for a refund or exchange.</p>
                        <p><b>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condition of Returned Products</b></p>
                        <p>We will verify that the returned product satisfies these Conditions of Sale and, if so, then proceed with the applicable refund or exchange.</p>
                        <p>Only products in a new and unused state, in perfect condition, with all protective materials in place and tags and stickers attached to them (if applicable), as well as with the original Maison box and delivery package, including all accessories and documents are eligible for return. For example, timepiece bracelets must be returned with the exact links as in the original delivery package. We reserve our right not to accept any return if the product shows signs of wear or has been used or altered from its original condition in any way or, as an alternative, may reduce the amount of any applicable refund or exchange accordingly.  If you have received free items as part of your order, they must be returned with the products.</p>
                        <p>All returns will be subject to strict Quality Control (“QC”) by us to ensure that the returned products satisfy these requirements. If the products do not meet QC standards, we will refuse the return, and the products will be returned to you.</p>
                        <p>Failure to comply with these Conditions of Sale will entitle us to refuse the returned product and send it back to you, at your own cost.</p>

                        <p>Only the buyer will be entitled to receive a refund of the purchase price. In no event will a person who has received the product as a gift (i.e. a “<b>Gift Recipient</b>”) be entitled to receive a refund. If you are a Gift Recipient and wish to return a product, please contact the Client Relations Center to discuss your options.</p>
                        <p>If the return complies with these Conditions of Sale, we will use commercially reasonable endeavours to refund the purchase price to the buyer using the same means of payment as used by the buyer for the initial transaction within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the returned item by the Maison e-boutique distribution center.</p>
                        <p><b>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchanges</b></p>

                    <div>
                        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim and exclude all other terms, conditions and warranties in relation to the products and Sales Channels whether express or implied by statute or otherwise or arising from any previous course of dealing or usage or trade practice.</p>
                        <p>Nothing in these Conditions of Sale limits or excludes our liability for any liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law.  Subject to the preceding sentence, our aggregate liability to you under these Conditions of Sale for any order whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, shall in no event exceed the one hundred percent (100%) of the price paid for the product(s) in your order.</p>
                        <p>Please note that in some jurisdictions, including the State of New Jersey, USA, consumer protection laws do not allow certain exclusions or limitation of warranties or liabilities, and consequently some of the above exclusions and limitations do not apply.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p><span>Arbitration Required, Except for Small Claims.</span>  Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or related to the Conditions of Sale, including the validity, invalidity, breach or termination of the Conditions of Sale, or to any product purchased from Maison through the Sales Channels, and any communications to or between us (a “Dispute”), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that a consumer or Maison may assert claims in small claims court if such claims qualify.</p>
                        <p><span>Informal Dispute Resolution.</span>  Before bringing any dispute in arbitration, you and Maison agree that you will first notify the other party and make reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve amicably any Dispute. This requirement is a pre-condition, and no claim shall be filed in arbitration (or small claims court) until this provision is first met.</p>
                        <p><span>Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver.</span> You understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to defend your rights, including to a trial by jury, under these Conditions of Sale. IN ADDITION, YOU AND MAISON UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE PARTIES WILL PURSUE ANY DISPUTE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  THE ARBITRATOR IS EMPOWERED TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITH THE SAME REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN COURT, INCLUDING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA..  YOU AND MAISON AGREE THAT EACH MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER AS PART OF ANY CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
                        <p><span>How Arbitration Works.</span>  In order to file a complaint for arbitration after you and we have failed to resolve our Dispute through the informal process described above, you can go to the American Arbitration Association’s website at https://www.adr.org/Support or call 1-800-778-7879. You or we must include documents sufficient to demonstrate that we followed the information resolution process with the filing of any arbitration complaint. At your election, the arbitration will be conducted through video conference, on the papers, or in the state and county where you reside (as determined by your address on file with Maison) or as otherwise agreed between the parties by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, also available from AAA. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. These Conditions of Sale shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and, where applicable, the laws of the State of New York, without reference to conflict of laws provisions.</p>
