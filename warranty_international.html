            <h3>INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY</h3>
            <p>The following International Limited Warranty applies to IWC watches purchased in the original labelled container/box in any country (including the United States of America, Canada and Australia) and
                presented for warranty service in the same or any other country.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS AND FOR HOW LONG</h4>
                <p>Your watch has been made according to the strict quality standards of IWC and with all the care of highly qualified watchmakers. The watch is covered by this International Limited Warranty against defects
                    in manufacturing and materials. Please contact one of the authorized IWC boutiques, IWC retailers or IWC
                    service centres located around the world (service contacts can be found at <a href="findStore.html">www.iwc.com/stores</a>) and they will be able to provide warranty service
                    as defined herein.</p>
                <p>IWC warrants its product against defects in materials and manufacturing for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of purchase stated on your original invoice and/or the warranty booklet (the
                    “Warranty Period”). If the product is returned during the Warranty Period, IWC will repair or replace any defective watch or part free of charge within a reasonable time after the product is returned,
                    subject to the exclusions mentioned hereunder and to the right to charge for shipping costs. Upon expiration of the Warranty Period, any repairs will be subject to a service charge.</p>
                <h4>HOW TO OBTAIN SERVICE</h4>
                <p>You may obtain service by bringing or sending the watch in the original labelled container/box to your authorized IWC boutique, IWC retailer or to any IWC service centre. You may be responsible for
                    transportation costs, including, but not limited to, postage, insurance and packing materials. We recommend that any shipments to us include certified delivery and insurance.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain service through this International Limited Warranty, the returned watch must be accompanied by the original International Limited Warranty card/certificate that was included with
                    the watch in the container/box at the time of purchase, duly completed, dated, stamped and signed by an authorized IWC boutique or IWC retailer. This International Limited Warranty card/certificate may
                    only be completed by an authorized IWC boutique or IWC retailer. </p>
                <h4>WHAT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY</h4>
                <p>The International Limited Warranty does not cover:</p>
                <p>(a) defects and damages due to loss, theft, flood, earthquake or fire, or other causes beyond our control;<br>
                    (b) defects and damages resulting from misuse or negligence, or from accident;<br>
                    (c) defects and damages caused by improper use (knocks; dents; crushing to the case, crystal, bracelet or strap, etc.), alterations (functionality or capability), tampering, dismantling, modifications,
                    or services and repairs completed by anyone other than an authorized IWC boutique, IWC retailer or IWC service centre, or by the use of components other than those recommended by IWC;<br>
                    (d) defects and damages due to normal wear and tear;<br>
                    (e) watches where the serial number originally imprinted on the watch case is removed or not clearly legible, or where any part of the original watch back or any original number has been removed,
                    changed, altered, replaced, erased or defaced;<br>
                    (f) lack of accuracy of the watch if within the limits of average industry tolerance;<br>

                <p><b>LIMITED WARRANTY</b></p>
                <p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE IS A LIMITED WARRANTY AND SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTY IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER EXPRESS
                    WARRANTIES. NEITHER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY NOR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
                    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SHALL EXTEND BEYOND THE PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR (24) MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR (24) MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, IWC WILL, AT ITS SOLE
                    DISCRETION, REPAIR OR REPLACE ANY DEFECTIVE WATCH OR PART UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY FREE OF CHARGE SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO CHARGE FOR SHIPPING COSTS, AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:</p>
                <p>THE RETURNED WATCH MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE IWC INTER­NATIONAL WARRANTY CARD/CERTIFICATE (ENCLOSED WITH THE WATCH), DULY COMPLETED, DATED, STAMPED, AND SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED IWC BOUTIQUE OR IWC
                    RETAILER. THIS IWC INTERNATIONAL WARRANTY CARD/CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE COMPLETED BY AN AUTHORIZED IWC BOUTIQUE OR IWC RETAILER.</p>
                <p>THE SERIAL NUMBER ORIGINALLY IMPRINTED ON THE WATCH CASE MUST BE CLEARLY LEGIBLE AND NO PART OF THE ORIGIN­AL WATCH BACK OR ORIGINAL SERIAL NUMBER MAY BE REMOVED, CHANGED, ALTERED, REPLACED, ERASED OR
                    DEFACED.</p>
                <p>IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, ALL OTHER CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED WARRANTY ARE  APPLICABLE TO THE IWC LIMITED WARRANTY IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
                <p>FAILURE TO ADHERE TO ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS VOIDS ALL WARRANTY RIGHTS. THIS WARRANTY IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. IWC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IWC does not
                    authorize any retailer or seller of its products to make any warranties beyond this Limited Warranty or to otherwise assume for IWC any obligations or liability in connection with the sale or distribution
                    of its products. Some states, provinces or terri­tories do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, thus the above
                    limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
                <h4>ADDITIONAL GUARANTEE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE IN AUSTRALIA ONLY:</h4>
                <p><b>MANDATORY STATUTORY RIGHTS</b></p>
                <p>Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably
                    foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.</p>
                <p>The Mandatory Statutory Rights apply only to watches purchased in Australia and presented for guarantee services in Australia. If you seek to rely on your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian
                    Consumer Law in relation to a defect in goods supplied, you may be entitled to recover any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage that results from the defect. This may include the costs associated with
                    transporting the watch to Richemont Australia Pty. Ltd. or an authorized IWC boutique, IWC retailer or IWC service centre. The International Limited Warranty gives you further benefits, which are in
                    addition to your rights and remedies under the Australian Consumer Law and any other laws in relation to the goods. Subject to your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian Consumer Law, IWC warrants
                    its product against defects in materials and manufacturing for the Warranty Period. If the product is returned during the Warranty Period, IWC will, at its sole discretion, repair or replace any
                    defective watch or part free of charge within a reasonable time after the product is returned, subject to the exclusions mentioned in “What is not covered under the International Limited Warranty” here above.
                    Upon expiration of the Warranty Period, any repairs will be subject to a service charge.</p>
                <p>Subject to your Mandatory Statutory Rights under the Australian Consumer Law, if you make a claim under this International Limited Warranty (instead of your Mandatory Statutory Rights) you may be
                    responsible for transportation costs, including but not limited to postage, insurance and packing materials. We recommend that any shipment to us include certified delivery and insurance.</p>
                <p><b>HOW STATE AND OTHER LAWS APPLY</b></p>
                <p>The International Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary in the United States of America from state to state and may in addition vary from one
                    country, province or territory to another.</p>
                <p><b>IWC SERVICE CONTACTS</b></p>
                <p>Only authorized IWC boutiques, IWC retailers and IWC service centres are entitled to provide guarantee service as defined herein. </p>
