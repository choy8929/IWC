                        <p>Like most platforms, IWC logs IP addresses and uses cookies and similar technologies that
                            allow us to recognise you and to customise your experience, and provide us with information
                            about the way our visitors access our Platform. You can find out more about how we use
                            cookies and related technologies below.</p>
                        <h4>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h4>
                        <p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your
                            computer or mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. They are used to
                            recognise your computer as you move between pages on a website, or when you return to a
                            website or mobile application you have visited previously. Cookies are widely used in order
                            to make platforms work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to
                            the owners of the platform.</p>
                        <p>We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering
                            your language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our Platform is used.
                            Cookies will tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Platform before or whether
                            you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more
                            relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                        <p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>First party cookies</b>, served directly by IWC to your computer or mobile device.
                                They are used only by IWC to recognise your computer or mobile device when it revisits
                                our Platform.
                            </li>

                                <b>Third party cookies</b>, which are served by a third party service provider on our
                                Platform, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your computer or mobile
                                device when it visits other platforms. Third party cookies are most commonly used for
                                platform analytics or advertising purposes.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. IWC uses
                            both 'session cookies' and ‘permanent cookies’. Session cookies exist only while your
                            browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Permanent cookies
                            survive after your browser is closed, and can be used to recognise your computer or mobile
                            device when you open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The Platforms use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve you ads
                            on third party platforms after you leave our Platforms, and we use third party analytics and
                            other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information
                            about the use of the Platforms and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers
                            are third parties that display advertisements, which are based on your visits to the
                            Platforms and other apps and sites you have visited. Third party ad serving enables us to
                            target advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in.</p>
                        <p>Third party tracking technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are associated with
