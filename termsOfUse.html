                            and products for your personal use. Whilst considerable effort has been made to ensure that
                            the visual representations of IWC Schaffhausen products displayed on the platforms are
                            representative of the colour, design and style etc. of the original products, slight
                            variations, distortions and/or differences may be apparent when compared to the original
                            product. This may, for example, be due to technical issues such as your browser or computer
                            settings. Accordingly, IWC Schaffhausen cannot be held liable for any apparent differences
                            in the product images represented on the Platforms and the original products. We strongly
                            advise you visit one of our boutiques or authorised retailers prior to making a purchase
                            online or by phone.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, IWC Schaffhausen enjoys a worldwide reputation for both the design and
                            manufacture of high quality luxury watches. To this end, it possesses its own sources of
                            creativity, in particular highly skilled teams of designers who conceive and perfect IWC
                            Schaffhausen’s creations. As a result, IWC Schaffhausen cannot agree to or accept to be the
                            receiver of unsolicited proposals of collaboration. Indeed, it is conceivable that IWC
                            Schaffhausen may already be working on similar ideas and/or creations. Consequently, you are
